# Background geolocation demo in Ionic 3
This application is a demo of the background geolocation functionality done with Ionic 3 and Cordova, usable in mobile environments.
It uses the [background geolocation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/background-geolocation/) cordova plugin.

## How to use it
It can be used in mobile environments only, because it dependency of Cordova.
It's neccesary to have the [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/) to compile the application to Android, iOS or Windows Phone.
